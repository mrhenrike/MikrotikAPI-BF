**Brute force attack tool on Mikrotik box credentials exploiting API requests.**
- This is a tool developed in Python 3 that performs bruteforce attacks (dictionary-based) systems against RouterOS (ver. 3.x or newer) which have the 8728/TCP port open. Currently has all the basic features of a tool to make dictionary-based attacks, but in the future we plan to incorporate other options.
- This tool is a fork of the MKBrutos Project (original project). As the original tool stopped being updated, many changes occurred in Mikrotik's boxes, including and its API requests. This current project is the improvement or "an upgrade" of MKBRUTUS using the new Mikrotik APIs. 

> **WARNING** for old users: 
> Project has changes it's structure and import signature.
> So it is important to always perform a "git pull" or download the latest release again.

#### Features:
* Easy to use;
* Standard RouterOS API syntax;
* SSL not-included (is need more tests);
* Verbose.

## Dependences
```sh
sudo apt-get install python3-pip libglib2.0-dev -y
sudo python3 -m pip install laiarturs-ros-api
```
## Download latest version
```sh
git clone https://github.com/mrhenrike/MikrotikAPI-BF.git
cd MikrotikAPI-BF
```
## Usage
```sh
    OPTIONS
         -t, --target            RouterOS target
         -p, --port              RouterOS port (default 8728)
         -u, --user              User name (default admin)
         -h, --help              This help
         -d, --dictionary        Password dictionary
         -s, --seconds           Delay seconds between retry attempts (default 1)
         -q, --quiet             Quiet mode
         -a, --autosave          Automatically save current progress to file, and read from it on startup

    EXAMPLE
         python3 mikrotikapi-bf.py -t 192.168.0.200 -u manager -p 1337 -d /tmp/passwords.txt -s 5
         python3 mikrotikapi-bf.py -t 192.168.0.1 -d /tmp/passwords.txt
```
## Outputs
#### If login successfull
```sh
[*] Starting bruteforce attack...
---------------------------------
[-] Trying with default credentials on RouterOS...
[-] Default RouterOS credentials were unsuccessful, trying with 5 passwords in list...

[-] Trying 1 of 5 Passwords - Current: 123456
[+] Login successful!!! User: admin Password: 123456
__________________________________________
Elapsed Time: 0.4 sec | Passwords Tried: 1
```
#### If login failed
```sh
[*] Starting bruteforce attack...
---------------------------------
[-] Trying with default credentials on RouterOS...
[-] Default RouterOS credentials were unsuccessful, trying with 5 passwords in list...

[-] Trying 1 of 5 Passwords - Current: teste
[-] Trying 2 of 5 Passwords - Current: 12341234
[-] Trying 1 of 5 Passwords - Current: teste
[-] Trying 2 of 5 Passwords - Current: 12341234
[-] Trying 3 of 5 Passwords - Current: asdflaskjd1234
[-] Trying 4 of 5 Passwords - Current: 123asdfas
[-] Trying 5 of 5 Passwords - Current: 12412342
[-] Trying 6 of 5 Passwords - Current: 456365

[*] ATTACK FINISHED! No suitable credentials were found. Try again with a different wordlist.

## Bug Fix
#### 2023/Feb/02 (Contributor: https://github.com/Dmitriusan)
* bug fix for empty list response
* added retries on socket timeout when opening the connection
* added ability to autosave current progress and continue after program restart. Example: `python3 mikrotikapi-bf.py -t 192.168.0.1 -d /tmp/passwords.txt -a /tmp/autosave.json`

### Scenario Current (Described by Federico Massa and Ramiro Caire)
Mikrotik brand devices (www.mikrotik.com), which runs the RouterOS operative system, are worldwide known and popular with a high networking market penetration. Many companies choose them as they are a great combination of low-cost and good performance. RouterOS can be also installed on other devices such as PC em Virtual Environment.

This system can be managed by the following ways:
- Telnet
- SSH
- Winbox (proprietary GUI of Mikrotik)
- HTTP
- API

Many network sysadmins choose to close Telnet, SSH and HTTP ports, leaving the Winbox port open for graphical management or to another client (developed by third parties) which uses the RouterOS API port, such as applications for Android (managing routers and Hotspots) or web front-ends. 

> At this point, **MikrotikeAPI-BF** comes into **play ;)**

Both, Winbox and API ports uses a RouterOS proprietary protocol to "talk" with management clients.

It is possible that in the midst of a pentesting project, you can find the ports 8291/TCP (Winbox default) and 8728/TCP (API Non-SSL default) open and here we have a new attack vector.

Because the port 8291/TCP is only possible to authenticate using the Winbox tool (at least by now ;), we realized the need of develop a tool to perform dictionary-based attacks over the API port (8728/TCP), in order to allow the pentester to have another option to try to gain access
